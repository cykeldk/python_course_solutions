    "# Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started with Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "You need the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/HelgeCPH/get_things_done_with_python/blob/master/Vagrantfile), which will provide you with an Ubuntu Linux (14.04.5 LTS) and a Python 3.4 installation.\n",
    "Actually, it is this setup running what you just see.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do I need?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following is a step by step guide to get you up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Download and install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\n",
    "  * Download and install Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)\n",
    "    * To get started with Vagrant on Windows, see https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/ Focus in particular on using PuTTY instead of SSH on Windows\n",
    "    * or alternatively install Git on Windows and follow the directions: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16247703\n",
    "    * On Unix'ish operating systems, if you did not already generate an SSH keypair, generate one (e.g., via `ssh-keygen -t rsa`)\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * Check out the infrastructure project into a directory of your choice (`/path/to/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/HelgeCPH/get_things_done_with_python.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On the command line change directory to where you cloned this repository (`/path/to/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /path/to/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Subsequently, start up the VM, which will take a bit on the first start up.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To log onto the virtual machine (VM) execute\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant ssh\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "  * On the VM activate the Python virtual environment (we will talk about this later)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ workon course\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Now you can start the Jupyter Notebook server (to program in the browser) via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ cd /python_course/notebooks\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token=''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In case you are done working on your virtual machine, you can leave it by issueing the `exit` command. Subsequently, you can put the virtual machine to \"sleep\" (just like closing the lid of your notebook) by running `vagrant suspend` on your host machine.\n",
    "  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ exit\n",
    "$ vagrant suspend\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python Directly to your Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you do not want to have Python running in a VM but directly on your computer, you can either install it directly, see https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-344/. However, we will not really spent time in this course to solve setup problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case, you use a direct installation of Python or the one that came bundled woth your OS, make sure that you are using Python >= 3.4, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "~$ python --version\n",
    "Python 3.4.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python on Windows\n",
    "Usually, Python is not included by default on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if it is already installed, enter `command` into the Start Menu. In the terminal window, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> python --version\n",
    "Python 3.4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see output like this, Python is already installed. If you see an error message, you will need to download and install Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing Python 3 on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Navigate to http://python.org/downloads/ and choose a Python version >= 3.4. \n",
    "  * Download the installer.\n",
    "  * Run it make and make sure to select the `Add Python to PATH option`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "After installation enter in the terminal again ```python --version``` and see it returning the Python version, which you just installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually Python is included by default on almost every Linux system. However, the system version might be too old for us. If so, first find out which version of Python you already have installed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal and issue the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python --version \n",
    "Python 2.7.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result shows that the default version is 2.7.6. However, you might also have a version of Python 3 installed. To check, enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python3 --version \n",
    "Python 3.4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.4.0 is also installed. As long as a version >= 3.4 is installed everthing is okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get -y install python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python on OS X\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is usually installed on macOS but likely in a 2.x version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal window, and enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python --version\n",
    "Python 2.7.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also try running the command `python3 --version`. You’ll probably get an error message, but it is worth checking to see if the version you want is already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Homebrew to Install Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only have Python 2 installed, or if you have an older version of Python 3, you can install the latest version of Python 3 using a package called Homebrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homebrew depends on Apple’s Xcode package. To install it open a terminal and run this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ xcode-select --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBS**: You should run this at home as it may take quite some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click through the confirmation dialogs that pop up (this may take a while, depending on the speed of your connection). Next, install Homebrew:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that Homebrew installed correctly, run this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ brew doctor\n",
    "Your system is ready to brew.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This output means you’re ready to install Python packages through Homebrew.\n",
    "##### Installing Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the latest version of Python 3, enter the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ brew install python3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And check with `python3 --version` for which version was installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start a Python 3 terminal session using the command `python3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a Python distribution, which comes already bundled with many modules and it might make your life easier in the beginning, see https://www.continuum.io/downloads\n",
